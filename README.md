OpenStudio-HelloWorld
=====================

Example of a third party program that uses OpenStudio. It requires a build of OpenStudio to compile.

The program is built using CMake (2.8 or newer should probably work). After the first configure, set `OPENSTUDIO_BUILD_DIR` to point to the OpenStudio build, configure again, and then generate.
